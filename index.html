    <p class="h hover">Who is she?</p>
    <p class="a">Fuuka Akitsuki (秋月 風夏 Akitsuki Fūka?) is the main protagonist of the Fuuka! anime series. She was the former vocalist and a singer for the band "The Fallen Moon". She was a very talented vocalist, even being described by others as an "overwhelming genius"</p>

  <div class="intro">
    <p class="h hover">Personality</p>
    <p class="a">Fuuka is an energetic person with a great spirit. She tries to be positive at risky times, so that they end happily. Fuuka was born shortly before Suzuka and Yamato (her parents) got married because of her birth. She lived in the same block of flats as her parents and when she was little she asked as a birthday present to have a brother. Some time later, as a birthday present, her brother was born.</p>

  <div class="intro">
    <p class="h hover">Chronology</p>
    <p class="a">Yuu initially meets Fuuka after an incident where she accuses him of taking a peek at her- Okay, let's not talk about that. Later on, she decides to form a band with Yuu, which is named "Fallen Moon" after her surname, and becomes the band's vocalist.

      They successfully perform at their school's school festival. Her fate involving a truck is different between the manga and the anime adaptation. In the manga she is accidentally killed whereas the anime has her surviving and following part of the manga story arc of Fuuka Aoi.

      In the end of the anime we do not know if Yuu and Fuuka started going out but it seems that they were holding hands and walking away.</p>
